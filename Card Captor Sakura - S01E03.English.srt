1
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,800
Hey look these fish are really cute.

2
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:33,066
The Sakura sure is enjoying herself. 

3
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:33,899
Yes she is.

4
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,400
She likes track meet and field trips and all that kind of stuff.

5
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,266
My name is Sakura Kinomoto.

6
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:44,733
I'm a fourth Grader at Tomoeda elementary school.

7
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:48,299
We're out on a social studies field trip today.

8
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,199
Each group went to a different public institution.

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,866
But we ended up going to the aquarium.

10
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:55,300
I love the aquarium.

11
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,466
The penguin shows about to start.

12
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,133
Okay okay.

13
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,333
Sakura that's...

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on you guys.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,066
Let's hurry.

16
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,666
Wow she's fast.

17
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,733
Penguins penguins penguins!

18
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,399
Sakura looks like she's having fun.

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,233
Sakura's Heart-Racing First Date

20
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,299
This is incredible.

21
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,866
Amazing.

22
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,266
I'd really love to swim with the penguins.

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,100
Well you are a very good swimmer Sakura.

24
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,333
There.

25
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,599
No, penguin keep away.

26
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:16,666
No penguin penguin.

27
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,599
Penguin.

28
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,333
I'm gonna save my penguin

29
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,133
Penguin.

30
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,599
No penguin.

31
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:28,666
What's going on?

32
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,966
A penguin's caught in the whirlpool.

33
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,133
But I can't get to him.

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,366
Wow.

35
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:56,999
That's my brother.

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,000
What?

37
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,500
Almost drowned? No you didn't.

38
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,200
That's not what I said.

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,700
You weren't even listening to me.

40
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,100
Oops.

41
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,266
Nobody was home.

42
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,733
So I thought I'd come out of your room for a change.

43
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,966
But I haven't been able to relax since.

44
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,766
Well that makes more sense.

45
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,600
You wouldn't be drowning.Would you Sakura?

46
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,766
Cause the one thing you're good at is sports.

47
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,066
What do you mean one thing?

48
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,766
You're not getting any cakes.

49
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,366
Oh please Sakura.

50
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,166
Anyway had penguin drowning.

51
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,799
That's really hard to believe.

52
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,399
The adults were wondering if maybe.

53
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,966
It was because the tank's plug had come out.

54
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:46,366
But that's not what it seem like to me.

55
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:47,933
Huh.

56
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:50,866
Here.

57
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,533
Actually no it wasn't like that at all.

58
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,766
It was more like...

59
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,933
It was more like something I should know.

60
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,866
What like when you see a clow card?

61
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:07,866
Huh.

62
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,266
I'm home.

63
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,533
Oh no.

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,500
Hurry get back to my room.

65
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,266
Hi.

66
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,199
Hi Touya.

67
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,533
Hi.

68
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,466
Touya you're at the aquarium today weren't you.

69
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,199
Duh.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,133
If you look it's written right there.

71
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,366
Touya I'm working at the aquarium.

72
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,566
Touya, how come you were at the penguin show?

73
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,899
What do you do?

74
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,866
Feed the penguins.

75
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,966
Really? That's so great.

76
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,199
No it isn't.

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
How come?

78
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,366
Just because.

79
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,099
No that's mine.

80
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,733
You can't just help yourself.

81
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,533
I saved up my allowance to buy that.

82
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,666
Hey what are you doing? Hurry up and come in.

83
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:07,500
Ahh?

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,333
I'm coming.

85
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,333
It took a while to get my shoes off.

86
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,100
Hello, how are you Sakura?

87
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,066
Yukito.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,400
Hello.

89
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,666
Those look delicious.

90
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,133
You're a good cook aren't you Sakura.

91
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,700
No not really.

92
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,999
That's right she's really not.

93
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,533
Yeah.

94
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,366
Would would you like some hot cakes.

95
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,366
I just bake them.

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,266
You sure you bought them with your allowance right?

97
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:43,333
That's okay.

98
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:47,066
I'll bring them up to my brother's room later.

99
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,199
Okay.

100
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,566
Oh no.

101
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,166
I can't knock on the door.

102
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,933
What am I gonna do.

103
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,499
I'll be right there Sakura.

104
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,733
Oh Sakura I didn't know you were here.

105
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,066
Um.

106
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,866
How did you know I was here when I didn't even knock?

107
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,100
I had a feeling.

108
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,866
You said you brought this up for us right?

109
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,733
The aquarium.

110
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:40,666
Water.

111
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:51,766
Sakura.

112
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:54,599
Hey Sakura what on earth happened?

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,066
I'm so happy.

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,466
Oh Yukito.

115
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,066
Hey let me go.

116
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:01,966
Uh huh.

117
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,799
Stop acting so silly would ya.

118
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:08,299
What about your mission as the card captor Sakura?

119
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,399
I'm more interested in Yukito.

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,100
I see so you don't care if the penguin start drowning again.

121
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,933
Oh no that'd be awful.

122
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,266
I thought that was the end of me.

123
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,599
Well this might be a bit of a problem.

124
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,600
Uh.

125
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:30,066
Now then I suppose the thing that almost drowned the trainer

126
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,033
and the penguin was in the water.

127
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:32,699
That right?

128
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:33,766
Hmm.

129
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,133
Okay tell me what you saw.

130
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,699
Did you see this thing while they were drowning?

131
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,233
I didn't.The water was just swirling around.

132
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,933
Then it's probably the water card.

133
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,666
I thought so.

134
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,666
So we just catch it and turn it back into a card.

135
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,133
It's not that easy.

136
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,566
We can't see the water card when it's in the water.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,933
And even if we're able to pull it out of the water.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,100
If it separates in different directions.

139
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,166
We won't be able to control it.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,500
It's hard to catch things like water that don't have a shape.

141
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:11,000
The water card has stronger magic

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,166
than some of the other clow cards.

143
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,533
It's difficult to use the four basic elements.

144
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,800
Earth, water, fire and wind.

145
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,900
And water is a card of untamed magic.

146
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,133
It has a very wild nature.

147
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,266
The cards you have so far are windy, fly and shadow.

148
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,666
But this one is beyond your power.

149
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,299
Even if you use windy.

150
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,166
Which has the same high strength of magic as water.

151
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,099
Windy wouldn't beat it because windy's kind.

152
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:46,599
Windy shadow fly.

153
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,533
Do we only have these three cards?

154
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,800
How can I catch water.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,566
Come on.

156
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:24,599
I've got to do something quick and catch the water card.

157
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,966
You seem down.

158
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,500
What's wrong Sakura?

159
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,499
No, I'm fine really.

160
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:38,166
Uh.

161
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,200
Seems like you've got a big challenge ahead

162
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,799
for the pact you made with the allies of justice.

163
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:53,366
Hmm.

164
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:56,333
Yes I guess a clow card is behind all of this.

165
00:10:56,766 --> 00:11:00,966
Yeah but Kero says that it's not gonna be as easy as all that.

166
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,299
Hmm.

167
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,266
Tomoyo.

168
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Yes.

169
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,333
Thanks for hearing me out.

170
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,399
You look so good when you smile like that.

171
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:26,999
Oh yeah this is for you.

172
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,800
This is a new product for my mom's company.

173
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:34,866
Here this one is for you.

174
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:38,866
And here's another one for Kero.

175
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,200
You sure we can have them?

176
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,866
Of course.

177
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:47,366
By the way my mother wants you to tell her how you like it.

178
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,466
Thanks for thinking of me.

179
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,066
Well see you tomorrow.

180
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,299
Yeah see ya.

181
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:06,066
But if we put all three cards together then sure.

182
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,133
It won't work.

183
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:09,800
No matter what you do with those cards you have.

184
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,533
It won't work.

185
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,933
Hmm hmm.

186
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,666
But the water card.

187
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:16,966
It's out there.

188
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,933
This is terrible.

189
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,333
Ah.

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,900
Are you okay Sakura?

191
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:42,266
Yu Yukito.

192
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,133
You should watch where you're going.

193
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,566
Yes I'm sorry.

194
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,399
Thanks for the cake yesterday they were delicious.

195
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,166
No not at all.

196
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:55,899
You're late. Have you just left your club?

197
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:57,999
You're in the cheerleaders club right?

198
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,200
Uh yeah.

199
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:03,699
Touya told me you hit him with your baton while practicing at home.

200
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,100
Touya how could you tell Yukito such a thing.

201
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:11,766
Can I take you out for a meal to eat to thank you for the cakes.

202
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,599
Really? Are you sure?

203
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,266
I found a place that's pretty good.

204
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:19,499
Let's meet tomorrow at one at the penguin park okay.

205
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,700
Sure!

206
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:33,533
Ah.

207
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh Yukito.

208
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,866
Oh not that again Sakura.

209
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,400
Hello Daidouji residents.

210
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,199
No one's able to take your call right now.

211
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:51,266
Please leave a message after the beep.

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,700
Hi Tomoyo guess what?

213
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm going on a date tomorrow with Yukito.

214
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,000
We're meeting at one. I'm so excited.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,766
I'll call you when I get back.

216
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:22,933
Um.

217
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,266
I was just wondering did I get the time wrong.

218
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,166
Um.

219
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,399
You're fifteen minutes early.

220
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,500
What about you?

221
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,300
I didn't want to keep you waiting Sakura.

222
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,466
So I got here early.

223
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,466
Hey this is...

224
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,733
Oh that's right.

225
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,066
You were just here the other day.

226
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,366
Weren't you?

227
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,666
Are we going in here.

228
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,566
That's right.

229
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,466
Aha.

230
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,333
So that's the aquarium.

231
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,666
This is just perfect.

232
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,566
You can check it the clow cards in here.

233
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:05,766
Yes and I can capture Sakura's first date on tape.

234
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:06,933
Hmm.

235
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,599
Heh heh heh.

236
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,366
Yeah do it.

237
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,166
What a huge fish huh.

238
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,866
Sure is.

239
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,733
I wonder if it's edible.

240
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,133
One person couldn't eat the whole thing.

241
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,066
I'm not so sure about that.

242
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:24,700
Oh?

243
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,599
Boy this is so touching.

244
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:31,399
Geez don't kids hold hands these days.

245
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,899
And candy bear.

246
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,866
Hey kid lay another finger on me and you'll get hurt.

247
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,866
They have moved on to another place.

248
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,466
See you around.

249
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Wow this is a real.

250
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:57,499
I didn't see any of this last time.

251
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,700
Cause of what happened to the penguins.

252
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,333
So I guess you didn't know there was a tea room.

253
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:03,333
Ah.

254
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:06,599
You can sit there and watch all the fish. Touya.

255
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,866
Uh, Touya.

256
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:14,066
Are you working with the penguins anymore?

257
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,933
They drained out all the water and are gonna do an inspection.

258
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,133
Huh.

259
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,266
Then what about the water card.

260
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,200
Must be nice not working in the freezer anymore.

261
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,799
That penguin food was locked up in the freezer.

262
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,300
Touya said it was really cold.

263
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:31,166
It doesn't really make any difference.

264
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,699
Cause now I'm in charge of making shaved ice.

265
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,966
A strawberry shaved ice here is really good.

266
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:37,866
Ah.

267
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Shaved ice.

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
Ice.

269
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,366
Bring us two please.

270
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:44,566
Okay.

271
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,933
You want an extra large.

272
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,666
Uh is there such a thing.

273
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:50,666
What?

274
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,999
Is this a chaperone date or what?

275
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,333
Sakura!

276
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:16,599
The water card.

277
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:22,933
Sakura. Yukito.

278
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:44,399
Sakura.

279
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:46,599
Are you all right Sakura?

280
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,533
Sakura.

281
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:55,933
Tomoyo.

282
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,099
Oh yeah.

283
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,333
Where's Yukito?

284
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:01,866
Glad you're okay.

285
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,466
I thought I was gonna die.

286
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:05,966
Is this what I think.

287
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,999
Yeah the clow card is behind this.

288
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,266
The water card is definitely here.

289
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,099
You saw it.

290
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,800
Hey wait a minute what are you two doing here.

291
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,733
Are you all right, Sakura?

292
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,099
Yeah.

293
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:27,066
Too bad we didn't get to have that shaved ice after all.

294
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,066
That's okay.

295
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,333
Shaved ice.

296
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Shaved ice ice.

297
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,733
Aha.

298
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:36,866
Yukito thank you so much.

299
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:37,733
Right.

300
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,500
There are 25.

301
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:44,366
Good night.

302
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,399
Right good night sir.

303
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,566
You're gonna enjoy this pro baseball broadcast and now.

304
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,133
Here's your daily.

305
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,566
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

306
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,700
No problem.

307
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:11,266
Here?

308
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,066
This is where the magic feels the strongest.

309
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,166
It's there.

310
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:22,933
Daidouji here.

311
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,733
Got it.

312
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:26,066
Yeah on the first floor of the basement.

313
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,266
Great now go ahead.

314
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,466
Water.

315
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,199
Come out.

316
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:44,400
Get back Kero.

317
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,733
Fly!

318
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,100
Nice job Sakura.

319
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,533
Now It'll be easy to catch the water card once it's frozen.

320
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,600
It was Yukito who told me about the freezer where the animal food is.

321
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,366
Thanks for your help Tomoyo.

322
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:19,533
I'm just glad I was able to help.

323
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,399
Well now it's about time don't you think.

324
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:37,266
Now return to your true form clow card.

325
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,766
You are clever to have thought of that.

326
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,666
It's all thanks to Yukito.

327
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,766
Yukito.

328
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,700
Oh man I think Sakura's frozen too.

329
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:12,733
Hey take one for me too well don keep it up Sakura.

330
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,200
Hidey-howdy-ho!

331
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,166
Have you all been doing your homework?

332
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:34,600
Yeah.

333
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Well that's good to hear.

334
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,466
Time for my very popular time slot.

335
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:39,666
Kero's corner.

336
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:43,366
Alright then kids let's see what I have for you today.

337
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:48,066
This week we saw another of Sakura's battle costumes

338
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:49,766
just like we did last week.

339
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,599
This videotape you're looking at now.

340
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,866
Was all recorded by Sakura's friend Tomoyo.

341
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:58,599
Boy, she's pretty good with the camera isn't she.

342
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,600
No wonder she's Sakura's number one camera crew.

343
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,733
But how was she able to capture all this on tape.

344
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,966
Hmm.

345
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:09,133
And now a costume checked by Kero.

346
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,166
First the jester's hat with a pompom on each end.

347
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:15,666
And the jester's shoes with pompoms too.

348
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:18,966
For the cloth you'll need something that's waterproof.

349
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:19,566
Okay well.

350
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:21,333
I think I'd better sign off now.

351
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,933
If I tell you too much today.

352
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,800
Then you'll have nothing to look forward to next time.

353
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,566
Hey, am I nice or what?

354
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
See ya.

355
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,899
Kero and I were cleaning together.

356
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,099
Then all of a sudden.

357
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,566
A big tree started growing out of the basement.

358
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,699
And our house was like a jungle.

359
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,666
How come?

360
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:48,399
Wait, is this because of the clow cards I found in the basement?

361
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,966
Next on card captor Sakura

362
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:53,199
Sakura's exhausting Sunday

363
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,266
Release!
