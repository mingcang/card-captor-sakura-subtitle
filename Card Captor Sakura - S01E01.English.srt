1
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:40,000
Hello, is someone there?

2
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm ready.

3
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Sakura and the Strange Magical Book

4
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,100
Morning already.

5
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,200
Sakura, your breakfast is ready.

6
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,133
Right!

7
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:43,166
My name is Sakura Kinomoto.

8
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,733
I'm a fourth grader at Tomoeda elementary school.

9
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,566
I like PE and music I hate math.

10
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:53,966
I'm a very energetic girl. And for my family

11
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
Good morning!

12
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,800
What's with all the stomping around?

13
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,466
I wasn't stomping!

14
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,266
Sounds like you were stomping from down here.

15
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,100
Well I wasn't stomping alright?

16
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,766
So you keep saying.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,700
But you sound like a monster when you walk around.

18
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,100
I am not a monster!

19
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,700
This mean person is my older brother Touya.

20
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,466
He's in grade 11

21
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,000
and goes to a high school next to my elementary school.

22
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:29,400
He's always teasing me just because he's a little taller than I am.

23
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,300
It really bugs me.

24
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,900
One day I'll grow ten times taller than him and squash him like a little bug!

25
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,100
Sweet revenge.

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,466
Nice to see you two getting along.

27
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:44,566
That's my dad Fujitaka.

28
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,733
He's a professor of archaeology at the university.

29
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:50,966
And not only is he very caring but he's a great cook.

30
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,300
I love him.

31
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Here you are.

32
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,300
It looks great.

33
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,166
Thank you dad!

34
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,066
And that's my family. 

35
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,833
What? My mom?

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,166
My mom passed away when I was three years old.

37
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
But don't feel bad for me.

38
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,866
I've got the greatest dad in the world and my brother's okay too, sometimes.

39
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:11,766
How is it? Great!

40
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:12,866
I'm done.

41
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,966
What? You're leaving?

42
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,333
Soccer practice.

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,633
Here. Thanks dad. 

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,666
See ya.

45
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,833
Hey, wait a second.

46
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,500
Thanks for breakfast.

47
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,600
You've finished already?

48
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,200
Well, here's your lunch.

49
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:38,566
Where's Touya?

50
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,200
He left already.

51
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,466
Do you have cheer leading today?

52
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,766
Yeah see ya.

53
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,700
Bye

54
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:50,300
Where did he go?

55
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,133
Right, got him.

56
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,300
Wait for me.

57
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,700
You know Sakura you can leave for school much later.

58
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,533
I know.

59
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,933
But then I wouldn't be able to see him.

60
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,100
Hey Yukito!

61
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,266
Oh, good morning.

62
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:32,266
Hey.

63
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,900
Morning Touya.

64
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,066
Good morning Sakura you're up early.

65
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:37,933
Yeah.

66
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,133
You should have seen her gulping down her breakfast.

67
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,400
I guess she showed him who's boss.

68
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,866
This is Yukito.

69
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,166
He's in the same grade as my brother.

70
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
I can't believe that two of them are friends.

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,166
He's so nice and caring.

72
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,566
Not at all like my brother and he's so cute.

73
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,966
Well, see you Sakura.

74
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,166
We're here already.

75
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:25,466
See you later.

76
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,366
He's so sweet.

77
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,300
He's quite a hunk.

78
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,200
Tomoyo?

79
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:41,400
Giving you a present as he's leaving he's quite a charmer.

80
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,300
Yeah.

81
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,700
Good morning Tomoyo, how are you today?

82
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:47,100
I'm well and a good morning to you.

83
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,466
This is Tomoyo, she's my best friend.

84
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,400
She's smart and beautiful.

85
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,133
And her father owns a really big company.

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,266
You should have seen your face it was so cute.

87
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:05,900
That candy in your hand and the look of love all over your face.

88
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,100
Was it really that obvious?

89
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,666
I just wish I had a camera to capture such a beautiful moment.

90
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,500
Good idea.

91
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,500
Tomoyo loves to take pictures and make videos.

92
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,766
And I'm one of her favorite models.

93
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:20,900
Hey Sakura

94
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,333
my dad just bought me a new video camera.

95
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,700
Do you think I could film you next time?

96
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,533
But there must be something more interesting for you

97
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,666
to make a video of than me.

98
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,733
But then look on your face

99
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:36,166
while you were holding that candy was so sweet and loving.

100
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,533
I'll bring the video camera with me tomorrow.

101
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:42,766
She's sweet

102
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,133
but a little weird.

103
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,266
And there he appeared a wild look in his eyes

104
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,466
his mouth gaping from the surprise.

105
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,766
But who wouldn't have been.

106
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,366
Had there ever been such a large orange.

107
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,333
That was such a strange dream.

108
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:04,333
That's a very cute drawing Sakura. What is it this?

109
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,333
This? Well it's...

110
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,333
Sakura? Yes.

111
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:08,300
Please read it aloud.

112
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
I'll tell you later.

113
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,933
Start from the 12th line.

114
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:15,666
There's no doubt the orange was something special.

115
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,533
But what came out was stranger.

116
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,200
WOW!

117
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:25,966
That's great  Sakura! Amazing!

118
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,300
Thank you for that Sakura.

119
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,200
Next we will practice our baton twirling.

120
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,533
Please collect your batons and line up.

121
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:34,566
Yeah.

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
That dream is still bothering me.

123
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,800
I'll ask Tomoyo what she thinks about it.

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,466
I've never seen Sakura drop her baton before. She's a pro.

125
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:09,133
But sometimes she's a real clutz.

126
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,400
I'm home.

127
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,566
I'll be home at 9.

128
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,766
Oh, dad's gonna be late tonight.

129
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,933
Is someone there?

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,866
I wish dad and Touya would come home now.

131
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,266
It's coming from dad's library.

132
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh no what if it's a robber?

133
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,266
I'll peek through the door.

134
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,400
And if someone's there. I'll call the police.

135
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,966
There's no one down here.

136
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,066
The book from my dream.

137
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,333
It's a card.

138
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,733
Wind?

139
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,566
That's weird.

140
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,133
Wind

141
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,400
Windy

142
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,066
What just happened?

143
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,499
Hidey-howdy-ho!!

144
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:21,866
Wow, Thanks a lot for finally waking me up.

145
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,100
Waking you?

146
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,866
Yeah, I've been stuck inside that book for a really long time.

147
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:30,200
It feels good to get out and stretch a bit.

148
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you?

149
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,333
A squirrel? Stop that! Is that a new toy?

150
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,766
I'm not a toy.

151
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,066
I am the guardian beast of the seal of this book.

152
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,366
I am Cerberus. 

153
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:44,900
The seal? Cerberus?

154
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,133
Correct.

155
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:50,933
It is my job to protect all the cards in this book from getting into trouble.

156
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,266
Where did they go?

157
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,700
Not here! Not there! where did all the cards go?

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Here.

159
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,400
Oh yes, this is a card. Oh thank goodness.

160
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,766
Well, where are the others?

161
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,066
Well, when I read the word windy,

162
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,200
this spin wind started blowing.

163
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,166
They all blew away.

164
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,099
Oh right. hahahahaha.

165
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:26,500
Say whaaaaaaat?

166
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,666
Well I'm done.

167
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,866
Where are you taking that?

168
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,666
I'll eat it while I'm studying.

169
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,900
Well, no good.

170
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,900
I can't get a sense of where any of them are.

171
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,333
Here. That looks delicious.

172
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,766
But I'm not hungry. You see this book contain the clow cards.

173
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:55,666
What are they?

174
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,600
They're dangerous.

175
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:01,966
The clow cards were all created by an old wizard named Clow Reed.

176
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,700
Every one of the cards has its own character

177
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,400
and is very powerful.

178
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,400
They have the ability to take over the world doing whatever they want.

179
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,766
Almost nothing can stop them.

180
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:17,533
But luckily before they could do any damage.

181
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,066
Clow Reed managed to capture them.

182
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,100
He made the book to keep the cards in. 

183
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,766
Then made a special seal and me as the guardian of that seal.

184
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,633
I've got to get those cards back.

185
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:33,533
And you are going to help.

186
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,166
Why do I have to?

187
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,166
Well, You're the one that unleash them when you use the wind spell.

188
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,100
But you told me it was your job to guard the seal

189
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,500
and make sure the clow cards didn't escape from the book.

190
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,000
Well, I guess I was sleeping. 

191
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,966
How long?

192
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:50,933
Thirty years.

193
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,933
And they made you the book's guardian?

194
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,066
I was tired! very tired!

195
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,900
So the noise I heard was you snoring.

196
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,300
Yes, but what's important is that you could open the book

197
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,866
which means that you possess magical powers.

198
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,733
So tell me your name.

199
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,499
I'm Sakura. 

200
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,800
Well, Sakura. Stand over there.

201
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,300
Key of the seal.

202
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,599
This girl will carry out the secret promise.

203
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,966
Her name is Sakura.

204
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:33,766
Key, bestow her with magical powers. Release the power!

205
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,666
Sakura, take the wand.

206
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,166
That's it.

207
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,300
You have now become the card captor.

208
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,100
Whaaaaaat?

209
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,866
I can't do this.

210
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:03,466
I really can't do it.

211
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,299
What a soft bed!

212
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,100
Hey, I can't be a card captor.

213
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,366
Is that clear?

214
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,433
Card captor, the one who catches the magical card doesn't that sounds cool.

215
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm an elementary school student.

216
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,733
And I won't be responsible for the fate of the world.

217
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:23,533
Don't forget it was your fault for losing the cards in the first place.

218
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,699
Well I wouldn't tell if the guardian hadn't been asleep.

219
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:31,533
What a strong wind!

220
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,633
Sakura!

221
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,533
What is that? 

222
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,866
it's a clow card. What?

223
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,266
That one is the fly card.

224
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,099
Don't just stand there, move!

225
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:50,633
Do what?

226
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:53,900
This will be the first mission of the card captor.

227
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:54,733
What?

228
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,299
You could have at least let me get changed.

229
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,000
The card capture must be prepared for battle at all times.

230
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,566
It's so big, I can't catch that.

231
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,266
You're the card capture!

232
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,100
Now use your magic.

233
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,233
Like I showed you, take out the key and say the spell.

234
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,366
Reveal your secret powers.

235
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,700
Reveal your true powers to me.

236
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:53,799
My name is Sakura and I command you

237
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
RELEASE!

238
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:08,400
Okay Sakura the fly card belongs to the wind category.

239
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,133
You should be able to catch it using the windy card.

240
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:12,666
Are you sure?

241
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,933
We're going to have to get much closer though.

242
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:25,566
Oh no, it's coming back.

243
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,366
Quickly use the windy card.

244
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,700
Hurry up it's coming back again.

245
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,966
Come on Sakura use the windy card.

246
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,366
Here it comes.

247
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,000
I can't do it.

248
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,333
You're the card captor if you can't stop it no one can.

249
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,533
Yeah but how?

250
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:52,966
I got an idea.

251
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:53,966
Where are you going?

252
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,100
Sakura!

253
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,500
Sakura!

254
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:17,966
Wind, form a chain to bind this bird.

255
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:54,733
I am Sakura the card captor and I command you to return to me now.

256
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:16,800
Hey good job Sakura.

257
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,866
I thought I was gonna die.

258
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:22,200
Oh you'll be okay. You're the card captor.

259
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,699
Forget it! I Don't want anything to do with this insanity.

260
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,133
If you think that was insane waiting till you meet a few of the stronger cards.

261
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:37,766
Well you've just captured the fly card.Why Don't you try it out?

262
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,933
Well I guess it wouldn't hurt. 

263
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,966
Now that's the spirit.

264
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,466
Fly!

265
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,900
Now isn't that better?

266
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah.

267
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:02,933
You know we make a great team, card captor Sakura.

268
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,200
Yeah.

269
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,466
I told you I never agreed to be the card captor!

270
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,166
Hidey-howdy-ho!!

271
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,700
My name is Cerberus and I'm the host of Kero's corner.

272
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:39,566
A little extra dedicated to all the fans of card captor Sakura.

273
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,266
And each episode I'll be coming to you with something different from the show.

274
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
Today for your pleasure. Ta-da! 

275
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,033
The Tomoeda school uniform.

276
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,200
There's two types

277
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,700
one with long sleeves and one with short sleeves.

278
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,500
As you can see, this is the long sleeve model.

279
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:01,166
It's navy blue and a super elegant design.

280
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,799
If you look on our left arm. You'll see the school logo.

281
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,166
And don't forget the really cute hat.

282
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:09,700
And now a costume check by Kero.

283
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:12,533
Today's costume check is the skirt.

284
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,000
Don't you think the white pleated skirt looks nice on Sakura?

285
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:18,000
This is the boys uniform.

286
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,766
That brings to a close of today's Kero's corner.

287
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:24,733
I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

288
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,799
And don't worry, I'll keep you updated with all the latest changes. See-ya!

289
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,533
I barely captured the fly card.

290
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:40,000
So I really don't think I can handle the job of card captor.

291
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,533
If my friends find out.

292
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,466
I'll have some big problems.

293
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,566
On top of that, Tomoyo says that she has a video that she wants to show me.

294
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,933
Don't miss the next episode of Card Captor Sakura.

295
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:54,033
Sakura's fabulous friends.

296
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,033
Release!
