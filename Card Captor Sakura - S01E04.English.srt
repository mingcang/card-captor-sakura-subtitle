1
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,533
Great it's sunny today.

2
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:30,933
You're right. The rain last night seems like a dream.

3
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:31,866
Anyway Sakura.

4
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,166
You're up early today considering it's a Sunday.

5
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,666
Hahaha.

6
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Uh.

7
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:44,066
I'm going on a picnic with Tomoyo to a park in the woods.

8
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,333
Hey. Why don't you come with us Kero.

9
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,666
If you stay in my backpack nobody will notice okay.

10
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,066
I'm so glad the weather cleared up.

11
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,300
Sakura's Exhausting Sunday

12
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,566
Good morning!

13
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,166
Good morning Sakura.

14
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,100
Pretty happy today huh monster.

15
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,333
I'll let you get away with that today.

16
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,166
Huh.

17
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:18,400
Yes you do seem to be in a good mood Sakura.

18
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:23,366
Haha sure I do. I'm going out with Tomoyo today.

19
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,700
But.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Ah.

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,933
You're doing all the housework today remember?

22
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,733
You traded with me last week don't you remember?

23
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,966
Weekend has a piano concert.

24
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,333
I sure like to goes here.

25
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,933
So which you mind...

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,466
Okay i'll trade with you.

27
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,100
Huh you will.

28
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,500
But on one condition in exchange.

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,000
You'll have to do all the housework next Sunday.

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

31
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:08,533
Well I'm off to work.

32
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay see ya.

33
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,300
Sorry.

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,500
The laundry's really piled up since it's been raining so much.

35
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,966
Listen, do you want me to help you?

36
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,700
You've got an academic meeting today.

37
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,800
Don't worry I'll be okay dad.

38
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,166
Sorry about this.

39
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,000
No problem.

40
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,666
All right then I'll leave this by the washing machine.

41
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:30,933
Okay.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,866
See ya.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,100
Bye Touya.

44
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,600
I'll be going as well.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,700
Hmm.

46
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,966
Have a good day.

47
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:40,466
See you later.

48
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,800
Oh is that right.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,133
I'm really sorry.

50
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:53,900
I completely forgot it was my turn to do the housework today.

51
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,566
It's okay it's not your fault.

52
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,466
I'm really sorry though.

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,500
Don't worry about it. Good luck with all your housework.

54
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,800
Thanks Tomoyo.

55
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,000
Well see you at school tomorrow.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,566
Yeah see you soon.

57
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,966
Poor Tomoyo, I'll give her a call tomorrow to apologize.

58
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:27,100
Well then time to get started.

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Kero, you okay?

60
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,766
Just because there's nobody around at home.

61
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,000
How come I'm stuck doing this kind of stuff.

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,400
Ah.

63
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:07,733
The wood.

64
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,300
This is a clow card.

65
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,833
Huh it stopped.

66
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,266
Kero Kero.

67
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,733
Yeah whoa.

68
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,566
Kero I found a clow card.

69
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:23,400
Uh huh.

70
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,966
He's not here. Well okay.

71
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,400
I'll brag about it later.

72
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,266
Uh.

73
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:38,400
What a daisy day it is!

74
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,166
Right that's enough.

75
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:47,700
This isn't the kind of stuff that I should be doing.

76
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,200
Oh yeah.

77
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,600
After we finished I'll have a popsicle with Kero.

78
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,866
Oh well I guess I can help out a little longer.

79
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,600
Right this is the last place to do.

80
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Oh no it's covered in ink.

81
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:22,733
Ah.

82
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,700
This is a clow card too.

83
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,400
This is my lucky day.

84
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,100
I found two cards one after the other.

85
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:30,733
Oh.

86
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:31,766
I'll clean them.

87
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,800
With towel with towel.

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,333
Oh the phone.

89
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,466
Okay I'm coming.

90
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,733
Hello, who...

91
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:46,766
Sakura?

92
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,366
Uh yes dad?

93
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,300
Could you see if there's a blue envelope on top of the table.

94
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,133
Yeah there is.

95
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,266
Sorry but could you bring it to the bus stop for me.

96
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,400
The materials for my lecture are in there.

97
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,700
I'll be right there.

98
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,600
Kero I'm just going out for a bit.

99
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,200
What's going on?

100
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,766
Bye dad.

101
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,200
Thanks a lot.

102
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,466
Sakura.

103
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:35,966
Ah.

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,100
Ah hi Yukito.

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,166
That was your dad wasn't it.

106
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,166
Everything okay yeah.

107
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,033
My dad forgot something that's all.

108
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,400
So you brought it to him.

109
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,300
Good girl.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Huh.

111
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,600
You're in your uniform.

112
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:53,466
Oh.

113
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:56,033
Yeah there was a basketball game today.

114
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,766
So I was just helping out.

115
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Actually Yukito doesn't belong in any clubs.

116
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,533
But he helps out sometimes as an assistant when there's a game or something.

117
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,600
Oh he's so smart and he could do anything.

118
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,566
Hey Sakura have you had lunch?

119
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,000
No not yet.

120
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,333
Wanna eat together? Right over there.

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,866
That's Touya.

122
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,333
Oh thanks.

123
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:37,933
That's your third plate.

124
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,400
He's three times as much as I do.

125
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:42,733
Three times?

126
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,200
Go on eat as much as you like Sakura.

127
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,700
It's my treat okay.

128
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,466
Kero's waiting for me at home so.

129
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,800
Oh who's Kero.

130
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Oh nobody hahaha.

131
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:57,733
Well it's good to have a big appetite.

132
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:58,766
It's healthy.

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,966
It's hard on the allowance though.

134
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,466
Yukito.

135
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,333
Thanks for forgetting your things dad.

136
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,066
I got to run into Yukito.

137
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,666
I'm home.

138
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:20,700
Kero.

139
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,366
Thank you Kero.

140
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,366
You sleep some more.

141
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:34,066
I'll make your lunch right away.

142
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,100
Kero.

143
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,533
Kero wake up.

144
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,600
What? Is it time for lunch.

145
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,866
What's that sound?

146
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:50,533
Sound?

147
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,200
Is it a burglar.

148
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,333
It's coming from downstairs.

149
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,266
I hope it's not a ghost.

150
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,866
Think a ghost would be here in the daytime?

151
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:06,966
Who knows, it might.

152
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:14,866
It's in the basement.

153
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,400
It's in there.

154
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,800
Go on.

155
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,966
Oh it's hard to see anything.

156
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,166
What the heck is that.

157
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,266
That's just a branch from a plant.

158
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:57,533
What's something like that doing coming up from the basement.

159
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:02,266
Hey the wood card is behind this.

160
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,266
The clow card?

161
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,400
Oh that reminds me now.

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,900
What?

163
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,800
You just left the clow cards you found without writing your name on them?

164
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
But they were still in the shape of cards when I found them.

165
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,900
And and then the phone just rang.

166
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
That's no good.

167
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,866
The cards will only listen to the person

168
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:23,400
who's the first to write down their names on the cards.

169
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,366
But they've been in the house all this time.

170
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,700
And nothing happens up until now.

171
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:28,733
Hmm.

172
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,666
And the wood card is such a gentle one too.

173
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,133
I can't imagine it doing anything bad.

174
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,000
Then what's happened.

175
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:36,966
Hmm.

176
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,566
Oh no Kero don't let go.

177
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,400
Kero do something quickly.

178
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,600
I can't do a thing. The things got me too.

179
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,533
What do I do?

180
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,800
I wonder who it is?

181
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,900
Who? You'll know when they come in.

182
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:23,333
If someone sees us like this the whole town will be talking.

183
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,200
And Kero they might think you're talking teddy bear.

184
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,333
Will try to sell you or something.

185
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:30,100
That'd be the worst.

186
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,566
Uh coming.

187
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,133
Why'd you answer them.

188
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,100
Come to think of it, it wouldn't be so bad.

189
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,900
Kero.

190
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,866
You shouldn't be talking to teddy bears.

191
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,100
You're mean.

192
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,266
Oh this isn't what it seems.

193
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:10,933
Hello?

194
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,500
Ah ah Tomoyo.

195
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,666
I thought it come over and help you with your housework.

196
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,566
Have you been pruning the garden?

197
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:33,333
No the clow card wood is behind this.

198
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:33,666
Oh.

199
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:37,200
Sakura now is the time to use the seal.

200
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,866
RELEASE.

201
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,300
Return to your true form now.

202
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,566
Clow card.

203
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,066
That's fantastic Sakura.

204
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,266
What's wrong is something the matter.

205
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,800
The card's not here.

206
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,900
That can't be.

207
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
It must have fallen around here somewhere.

208
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,733
How about over in that room.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,566
Oh yeah the basement.

210
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,666
Good let's go get that card.

211
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:25,066
Yeah.

212
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,400
Sakura.

213
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,866
It seems to have stop now.

214
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,300
Yeah it seems to be happy having the sunlight on it.

215
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,733
Yes just like a wood card.

216
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,966
The laundry it's ruined.

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,533
Oh no.

218
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:30,700
No I have to start all over again.

219
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,500
Don't let it get you down Kero.

220
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,233
I'll help you out okay.

221
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,400
Oh I have to start all over.

222
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,333
Anyway what are we gonna do about this.

223
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,700
If I use the seal it'll just go back to its former state.

224
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,866
Of course it will.

225
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,866
Go and get the card now and let's finish sealing it up.

226
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,600
You mean go to the basement?

227
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:51,566
Right.

228
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,366
What's that sound?

229
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,866
Sounds just like an outfit walking.

230
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,800
No it's the house creaking.

231
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,166
The tree is still growing.

232
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,766
But it was quiet up to a minute ago.

233
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,366
Do you think it's figured out the light comes from outside.

234
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:11,266
Yeah now it wants to get the light to its whole body.

235
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,566
It'll destroy the house.

236
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:13,866
No.

237
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,900
It's time for us occur on the card captor.

238
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Hmm why did you bring this clothes over?

239
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,166
I want to make a video of you dancing.

240
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:37,200
And doing your magic and your battle dress in this wonderful jungle.

241
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
And look she's made this lunch for us too.

242
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,000
You can get through here.

243
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:58,866
Ah.

244
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,333
This way.

245
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,600
Ah.

246
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,266
Just a little further.

247
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,566
Ah ah.

248
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:17,866
We better hurry.

249
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,400
What's that sound?

250
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,866
I'm not sure.

251
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,766
Oh water.

252
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:32,766
The water can't possibly come from the wood card.

253
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,133
So It's from the other card.

254
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,733
What's that? You mean there were two cards?

255
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,700
Yeah.

256
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,500
So that means...

257
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh.

258
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,900
Hey it was rain.

259
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,533
Rain?

260
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes.

261
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
The rain card.

262
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,100
The rain card got together with the wood card.

263
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,933
And they created this jungle.

264
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:57,700
You ready?

265
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:58,900
Yeah.

266
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,733
The cold at moment.

267
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,366
Rain wood.

268
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,100
That's as far as you're gonna get.

269
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,100
Looking good.

270
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,366
Sakura it's coming.

271
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,200
Alright this isn't bad at all.

272
00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:25,200
Uh huh.

273
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:41,133
Sakura hurry. It's just toying with you use the seal.

274
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:41,966
 Sure but.

275
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:44,700
Okay.

276
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,466
Hey I know, go after the wood card.

277
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,300
Try going after with water.

278
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,133
Water card.

279
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:54,966
Right.

280
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,466
Oh darkness that created the cards.

281
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,366
Lend me the power of the key.

282
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:03,566
And give me the power.

283
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:07,266
To transfer the magical powers of the card to this key.

284
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,200
Water!

285
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,466
A water become a chain of restrain.

286
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,566
Alright you got it.

287
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,933
Return to your true form now.

288
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,000
Clow card.

289
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,166
Hey you did it.

290
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:55,500
Okay next.

291
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,866
I have to take care of the one that tried to destroy our house.

292
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,866
Wait, hang on a second.

293
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,633
See I told you it was a gentle card didn't I.

294
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:47,466
I guess rain and wood really are good friends.

295
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:47,933
Oh.

296
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,200
Hey look at that!

297
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,000
Ah a rainbow.

298
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,766
It's beautiful.

299
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,666
Sakura done.

300
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,900
If you had written your name on the cards earlier.

301
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,633
We wouldn't have had all that trouble you know.

302
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:02,933
Yeah.

303
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,766
I've learned my lesson now.

304
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,633
In that case I'll get myself some shut-eye.

305
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,366
Good night.

306
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,300
Sorry about all this.

307
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,100
Not at all.

308
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,666
I got much better film on video

309
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,300
than what I would have gotten in the park you know.

310
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,633
Oh I see. 

311
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:20,166
Sakura, come quickly.

312
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:29,800
Oh no.

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,333
I'll have to clean all over again.

314
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,400
Don't worry I'll help you Sakura.

315
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,266
Oh thank you so much.

316
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm home. I'm home.

317
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,466
Thanks for doing all the housework.

318
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,200
We'll have some cake later on.

319
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:01,900
Better write your name on it or shall wolf it all down.

320
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,800
I did write my name. I did.

321
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:31,166
Hidey-howdy-ho!

322
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:34,133
Have you all been brushing your teeth properly?

323
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,100
It's time for the very popular time.

324
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,533
Slot of Cerberus the dandy Kero's corner.

325
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,733
Let's see what I have for you today.

326
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:47,133
This week we saw another of Sakura's battle costumes.

327
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,500
Make sure you listen to my description okay.

328
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:53,533
This costume was made with a theme of wings as you can see here.

329
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,800
The colors are pretty cute don't you think.

330
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:58,900
And the whole costume is made of rubber as well.

331
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,966
The shoes are safe and comfy high cut shoes.

332
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,100
And the gloves have this guard on them for protection.

333
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,066
Go go costume check.

334
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:13,300
The thing to note this time is the cute feathers on her head.

335
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,000
It's just like a headband.

336
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,733
Oops looks like our time is up.

337
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,300
Well are you getting familiar with my show.

338
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,933
There's lots of good things coming up in the future.

339
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,600
So I hope you'll look forward to it.

340
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,133
See ya.

341
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
A stuffed toy shop called the twin bells has just opened up.

342
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,166
Hey maybe I'll go there with Chiharu.

343
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,066
But Tomoyo tells me there's a strange rumor about the shop.

344
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:48,900
And that rumor will be left to card captor Sakura.

345
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:49,866
Next episode

346
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:53,300
Sakura and the panda and the wonderful store.

347
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,666
Release!
