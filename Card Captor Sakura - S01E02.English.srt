1
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:26,966
Sakura's Fabulous Friends 

2
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,500
Sakura

3
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,600
Sakura

4
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,466
I couldn't eat another bite.

5
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,333
Hey you're the one that wanted to get up early.

6
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,000
Now come on! It's seven AM.

7
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:51,666
That's a funny voice. It's not my dad or my brother.

8
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:56,000
Maybe it's the TV.

9
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,333
Oh, it's not on.

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
Well, what's that voice?

11
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,533
Ha ha!

12
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:09,733
What's wrong?

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,866
A stuffed animal?

14
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,600
You're still half asleep.

15
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,000
Wake up sleepy head.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,500
ah ah oh yeah

17
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,600
You're the keeper the clow cards.

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,933
Glad it's all coming back.

19
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,533
I am Cerberus, the guardian beast.

20
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:33,200
I remember though I can't say I understand any of this.

21
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,200
It all happened

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,466
when I found a glowing book in the basement yesterday.

23
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:41,166
I accidentally let the magic cards out.

24
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,533
And now it's my task to gather them all back up.

25
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:49,300
What a beautiful morning card captor Sakura.

26
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,133
I told you I can't be the card captor.

27
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,300
hahaha

28
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,966
Well sure you can.

29
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,466
see

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,733
You've already recaptured the fly card.

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,666
See you look.

32
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,933
But I almost got killed!

33
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,000
Breakfast is ready!

34
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:11,166
Coming!

35
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,933
Good morning Touya.

36
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,166
You're actually ready on time

37
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,533
or maybe I'm late.

38
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,133
I had someone to wake me up all right

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
huh

40
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,933
I mean the alarm clock silly.

41
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,400
Hi mom good morning.

42
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,566
Well good morning.

43
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,033
Hi, morning dad.

44
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:43,100
Morning.

45
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,933
Well this looks great.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,800
It's because the monster didn't touch it.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,500
Well it's getting cold shall we eat now.

48
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:03,900
I finished.

49
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,200
You're up early today Sakura.

50
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,300
I'm on cleaning duty at the school.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,100
huh

52
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,100
Weird kid.

53
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,766
You're back.

54
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,733
I brought you something.

55
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,733
ah

56
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,466
wow

57
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm going now.

58
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,000
You sure do go to school early.

59
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:46,166
Touya and dad will go to school pretty soon.

60
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
Once they're gone

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,866
you can turn on the TV or something.

62
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:50,766
So your dad's still a student?

63
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,333
He's a university professor.

64
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:56,266
It would be better if you stayed up here while they're home.

65
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,033
I think you'd scare them.

66
00:04:59,033 --> 00:04:59,833
Sure!

67
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,900
huh

68
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,866
Is that the time? See you later!

69
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,300
See ya!

70
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,666
I'll take a shortcut.

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,300
hahaha

72
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,100
This is Yukito's house.

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,100
I guess he's not around.

74
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:38,866
Hello

75
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
You scared me.

76
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,266
Morning Sakura.

77
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,800
Oh morning Yukito.

78
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,333
You're early.

79
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,100
I'm on cleaning duty.

80
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:49,966
Alright

81
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,933
Ah I forgot!

82
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,200
For your classroom.

83
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,466
Are you sure?

84
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
hmm

85
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,300
wow

86
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,566
Oh thank you so much for these.

87
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,533
Nice to see you again.

88
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,066
Thanks again!

89
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,466
See ya!

90
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,933
He's wonderful.

91
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,366
Yes! I made it first.

92
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:39,466
Hey you're here early. Morning.

93
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,766
Good morning Tomoyo.

94
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,366
It's beautiful outside.

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,133
Are you on cleaning duty as well this morning.

96
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,400
That's next week.

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,300
I came in early because I have something I wanted to show you.

98
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,266
huh

99
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,166
A video? Just watch.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,966
I took it last night.

101
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,166
And what was that?

102
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,233
Let me show you my favorite part.

103
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,300
Did you find another clow card?

104
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,933
Which one is it? Get ready we have no time to lose.

105
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:34,766
oh

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,266
hey

107
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,133
Wow it's you.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
It's hot in there.

109
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,666
Why did you hide in there?

110
00:07:55,866 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, I wanted to see what a typical day in the card captor's life was like.

111
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,733
ah

112
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,766
Come on Sakura, aren't you gonna introduce us.

113
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,266
He says his name is Cerberus.

114
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,933
He doesn't look like a Cerberus to me.

115
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,666
More like a Kero Chan, right?

116
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:14,700
Much better. 

117
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,133
My name is not up for discussion.

118
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,100
I am Cerberus

119
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,400
the guardian of the seal

120
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,466
the protector of the clow cards.

121
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,400
Clow cards?

122
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,900
Hey, try this.

123
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:39,500
And that Tomoyo is how Sakura became the card captor.

124
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,066
That's just incredible.

125
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,033
The card captor is here to protect our town

126
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,466
from the disastrous clow cards.

127
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:48,700
That's so cool.

128
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,766
Come on Tomoyo. I can't do anything like that.

129
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,533
Oh no I'm sure you can.

130
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,566
Do you think you could show me some of your special magic Sakura.

131
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:58,333
What?

132
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,366
That's a great idea Tomoyo.

133
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,500
But.

134
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,300
This is perfect. No one's around but us three.

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
um

136
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,533
Reveal your secret powers.

137
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,966
Reveal your true power to me. 

138
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:26,966
My name is Sakura and I command you.

139
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,566
RELEASE!

140
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:40,100
Is that your magic staff for spells.

141
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,400
Well I need the cards too.

142
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,933
You mean this.

143
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,933
Is that safe?

144
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,966
So do you have a special pose too?

145
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,333
A special what?

146
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,300
Cause all magical girls have special poses for their spells.

147
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:58,566
bye bye

148
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,500
bye bye see you later

149
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:00,933
goodbye

150
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,500
I'll give you a call again.

151
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:04,400
see you tomorrow

152
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,266
okay bye

153
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,400
see you later

154
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,533
yeah

155
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,300
Morning. Hey. What are you doing?

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,533
oh morning morning

157
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,766
What's going on?

158
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,933
Oh, hi Sakura.

159
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:48,866
Look!

160
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,800
What happened here?

161
00:10:58,933 --> 00:10:59,766
I don't know.

162
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:01,933
It was like this when we got here.

163
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
ah ah

164
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,800
Who would do such an awful thing?

165
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,733
More importantly

166
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,933
this is going to take us a really long time to clean up again.

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,866
ah

168
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,000
ah?

169
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,166
Morning Tomoyo.

170
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,933
Good morning.

171
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,666
Wow this shirt is a big mess.

172
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,300
I wonder who could have done all this

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,600
Do you think maybe this is the doing of one of the clow cards.

174
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,466
huh

175
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,466
hmm

176
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,566
Yep, that's a clow card alright.

177
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,533
Knew it.

178
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,366
It made a huge mess.

179
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Took us forever to clean it up.

180
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:49,200
At least we got out of math class this morning.

181
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,500
Oh yeah I guess that was kind of nice.

182
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,900
So what kind of clow card

183
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,600
would cause that sort of miss to the school?

184
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:56,800
hmm

185
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,100
I don't know.

186
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:00,566
Alright Sakura.

187
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,866
It's time to be the card captor.

188
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:03,866
But why me?

189
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,933
If it's the work of a clow card.

190
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,666
You're the only one who can catch it.

191
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,500
I don't wanna be the card captor.

192
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:12,800
Well then you shouldn't have let them all out.

193
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,766
Get ready because we're taking back the school tonight.

194
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,466
What? Tonight?

195
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,500
Not a chance!

196
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,300
Why not?

197
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,200
Well, because it's really scary.

198
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,400
oh

199
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:31,500
There's no way I'm going there at night.

200
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,800
A lot of the cards don't come out until night.

201
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,466
You better get used to it.

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,300
It could be quite dangerous in the school at night.

203
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:40,666
Oh, Tomoyo.

204
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
So in that case I better come with you.

205
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,366
I'll be there to capture your brave and selfless deeds on my video.

206
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,300
But how come?

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,166
Because making videos is my passion.

208
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,733
Alright, tonight the three of us take the school.

209
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,700
In that case

210
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,366
we'd better get to work on your cute magical girl pose.

211
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:02,733
Right.

212
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,333
Training starts now.

213
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,166
No.

214
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,866
I'm scared.

215
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,600
Don't worry I'm right here what could go wrong.

216
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,400
Hahahaha!

217
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,266
You're not making me feel better.

218
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:23,600
huh huh

219
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

220
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,733
No, we just got here too.

221
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:36,866
huh

222
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,600
They take me everywhere.

223
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,800
These are my private bodyguards.

224
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,500
Goodbye miss. Careful.

225
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,366
Thanks, I'll call you when I need to be picked up.

226
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,366
wow

227
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,466
That's so cool!

228
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:09,100
There aren't very many school kids

229
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,266
who have their own bodyguards.

230
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:11,966
Oh yeah.

231
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:15,700
Well, there are even fewer who have their own magical powers.

232
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Yes so.

233
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,200
Now then come with me.

234
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,700
Wow, what's this?

235
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,566
Time for you to get changed.

236
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:37,933
What? But why?

237
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,166
Well you're going into the school to catch the next clow card.

238
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,066
Aren't you?

239
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:42,733
I guess.

240
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:46,600
You can't be a magical super girl without the right outfit.

241
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,233
What?

242
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,333
Now, that's the spirit.

243
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,933
You want the clow cards to know

244
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,666
they're dealing with someone special.

245
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:56,600
You can't be outshine by those silly cards.

246
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,466
Oh I couldn't have said it better myself.

247
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,000
So, time to get changed.

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,900
I've got a really great hat.

249
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,933
Come on, in you go.

250
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,500
You look fabulous so cute.

251
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,266
This is embarrassing.

252
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:27,300
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

253
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,500
Hmm, that's right.

254
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,966
I have something for you to wear.

255
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:31,766
Huh, for me?

256
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,133
Wow.

257
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,500
You two look so much cuter now that you match.

258
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,566
You think so.

259
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,266
I won't be cute if I die.

260
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,200
What do you guys think that noise was?

261
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,333
You heard something?

262
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,533
I think I can feel a clow card.

263
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,633
Let's go home.

264
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:15,400
Calm down.

265
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,100
Did you just see that?

266
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,766
That big statue is floating.

267
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,266
Look Sakura, look.

268
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:35,333
A shadow but no body.

269
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,333
A shadow?

270
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,733
Are you sure this is one of the clow cards?

271
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,866
Positive.

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
The shadow card is doing this.

273
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,266
Cerberus take Tomoyo somewhere safe.

274
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,900
It's time Sakura.

275
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,866
Reveal your secret powers.

276
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,366
Reveal your true power to me.

277
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,733
My name is Sakura and I command you

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,700
RELEASE!

279
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,400
looking good.

280
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,866
Wind card form a chain to bind the shadow, Windy!

281
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,966
Quickly Sakura use your fly card and get out of there.

282
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,000
Fly!

283
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,200
wow

284
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:04,166
The shadow card must have gathered together

285
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,966
the shadows of all the students at the school.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,233
It's using them all against the Sakura.

287
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:11,233
It's just too many for her to fight.

288
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,800
Is there some other way for her to fight them?

289
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,100
Well if the shadows of the students are struck by light.

290
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,400
They will all disappear leaving only the bad shadow for Sakura to fight.

291
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,966
But the problem is that it's night right now.

292
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,300
Leave that part to me.

293
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:30,866
I've got a good idea.

294
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,066
I told you I couldn't deal with this.

295
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,466
What am I gonna do?

296
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,400
Hey, let go of me!

297
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,866
ah ah

298
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,200
ah

299
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,766
Somebody help me!

300
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,566
huh

301
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,466
The shadows are gone.

302
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,500
Sakura.

303
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,400
They all just disappeared,

304
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,900
All about the bad shadow disappear when they're struck by light.

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And we couldn't wait for the sun to come out.

306
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,466
So we decided to turn on every light in the school instead.

307
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh thank you Tomoyo.

308
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,900
huh

309
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,766
Sakura, I can see the bad shadow.

310
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,166
This is your chance to catch it.

311
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,500
Let's see if all that training paid off.

312
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:16,400
Wind card form a chain to bind.

313
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,300
windy

314
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,933
Time to return to your true form.

315
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,866
Clow card!

316
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,266
Alright!

317
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,733
Victory two for Sakura the card captor.

318
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,900
Looking good Sakura.

319
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,566
Hey, Chiharu have you seen Tomoyo?

320
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:14,200
I think she's in the audio visual room.

321
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,400
Thanks a lot.

322
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:27,233
Tomoyo, thank you so much for helping me.

323
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,133
I got you a little... ah

324
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:30,066
What?

325
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,800
What a true masterpiece of film.

326
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,666
So you actually got all that on your camera?

327
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
Of course.

328
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:48,566
I didn't miss a single second of your heroism last night.

329
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:52,266
And I hope from now on you'll take me along with you

330
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,866
when you catch clow cards.

331
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:54,666
What?

332
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,700
I wanna have all the card captor's bravery captured forever.

333
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,400
ahaha Tomoyo

334
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,700
also

335
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,166
I'd like to be in charge of your outfits from now on.

336
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,633
I've got some fabulous ideas on how to use a lot more ribbons.

337
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:31,700
Hidey-howdy-ho!

338
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:32,766
How are you all?

339
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:35,666
And welcome to the second edition of Kero's corner.

340
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,966
That little extra that delves into the finer points of our show.

341
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:40,666
So without further ado.

342
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,700
Let's see what we have for you today.

343
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:47,333
This time we saw the appearance of Sakura's battle costume.

344
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,400
A real masterpiece made by her friend Tomoyo.

345
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,300
This is Tomoyo Daidouji.

346
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
She's more than just a pretty face.

347
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,866
She's a smart fourth grader.

348
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:57,866
Not only is she good at everything

349
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,666
but her newest hobby is making the costumes that Sakura will wear into battle

350
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,766
then filming the entire event on her video camera.

351
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,733
And now today's costume check.

352
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:12,200
Today it's the hat Sakura wear in the battle

353
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,133
with long ribbons ending in gold ornaments.

354
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,666
Honorable mention goes to her great kit.

355
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,199
Well that's all the time we have today.

356
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,966
But I hope to see you next time

357
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,566
when we'll be taking another extra special look

358
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:28,033
into the amazing costumes on card captor Sakura.

359
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:28,566
See ya!

360
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:35,933
It's like a dream come true.

361
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,900
I'm going to the aquarium with Yukito.

362
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:42,500
But trouble arrives when a clow card suddenly shows up.

363
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:46,566
There's no way I'm letting that thing spoil my date with Yukito.

364
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Next time on card captor Sakura.

365
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,933
Sakura's exciting date

366
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,466
Release!
